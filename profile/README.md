Welcome to the official GitHub profile for UQ MARS. Here you'll find many of the resources that we have available to members. To get started, you can take a look at [our constitution](https://github.com/uqmars/constitution), or browse some of our [other repositories](https://github.com/orgs/uqmars/repositories).

If you are looking for some of our project-oriented repositories, such as our [project briefs](https://github.com/uqroboticsclub/Projects2025), you can find these on the [UQ Robotics Club organisation](https://github.com/uqroboticsclub).
